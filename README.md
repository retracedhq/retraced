Key responsibilities of the retraced API include:

- Receiving and storing CreateEvent requests
- Creating ViewerTokens to power the embedded `logs` viewer
- Responding to queries from embedded `logs` with results from Elasticsearch
- Probably some EITAPI stuff
- Handle Auth0 login callback
- Tokens, stats, etc.

## Swagger Documentation

Swagger spec is generated from source using [TSOA](https://github.com/lukeautry/tsoa)

By default, a swagger spec is built as part of `make build`, and is served by express at `/publisher/v1/swagger.json`.

In staging/production, these specs are fed to [readme.io](https://readme.io), but it is possible to generate/preview them locally.


#### Generating a spec

To generate swagger.json from Typescript sources use

```
make swagger
```

The outputs will be written to build/swagger.json

#### Previewing a spec

The first time you generate markup, you will need to `make markup-deps` to install tooling.

Then you can 

```
make markup-docs
```

which will build `build/swagger.adoc`, convert to `build/swagger.html`, and open using `google-chrome`


## Building library images for on-prem
